# English_level
This project can determine difficult of eng_level by subtitles


The model can take file .srt and make some preprocessing actions (cleaning text, create new features for model) 
and then via catBoostClassifier(GradientBoosting) fitting and determine level of English(difficulty). I hope that this code will be usefull for you!!!

With love,
